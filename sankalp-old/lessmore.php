Sankalp is a non-profit social organization run by the students of NIT 
Jamshedpur. We provide free and quality education to underprivileged 
children living in slums and villages near the college campus, by giving
 evening tuitions. Besides taking care of about 140 such children, we 
also admit the meritorious students in good private schools. We also lay
 emphasis on the upliftment of the people in the slums by organizing 
free medical check-ups and cleanliness drive.</p>
