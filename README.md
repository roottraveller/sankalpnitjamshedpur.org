# sankalpnitjamshedpur.org


This code contains official source code of Sankalp, an NGO, run by NIT Jamshedpur Alumni and in-campus Students. 
I along with my friend Ashu designed and developed this site in feb-2014 as a trail project. 

Before this there was no official website for Sankalp which is started in year 2007 by our Alumni. 

this site was hosted @ http://www.sankalpnitjamshedpur.org/

Since I have left collage in 2015, there may be changes in UI or DB level.
