                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p> Being a certified NGO, Sankalp has a well organized, structured composition that has various groups to take care of several core areas of functioning. These include Academic, Admissions, Exams, Public Relations, Maintenance and others. A detailed description is available on our Volunteers page. </p>

                        <p> Though students of NIT Jamshedpur volunteer in Sankalp but the college administration does not play any role in the functioning of Sankalp. Sankalp functions as a certified NGO formed under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860. It is solely managed by the governing council of NGO while the students enrolled in the graduation and post-graduation programme of NIT Jamshedpur engage in everyday affairs of Sankalp and teaching at the centre.</p>

                        <p> Inductions are done for volunteers every year in the first year of graduation at NIT, Jamshedpur. There is no restriction on the number of students that will be selected. No form of registration fee has to be paid to be a part of Sankalp. We just look for devotion to work for the poor. However if you wish to contribute to Sankalp through monetary means or by sponsoring a child, you can contact us as at contact@sankalpnitjamshedpur.org. </p>

                        <p> Yes, this is possible. An extension of Sankalp can be started in any other college, school, and a local community to promote education. However, the person or group willing to start the group must have worthy credentials and should have a passion to serve the society. Regarding this, we can be contacted on contact@sankalpnitjamshedpur.org or on one of the contacts of the Public Relations member given on the Contacts page.</p>
