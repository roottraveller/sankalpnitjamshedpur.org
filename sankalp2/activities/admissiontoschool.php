                        <p>Education is the right of each and every child of India. We work for their right and provide Primary 
                            education  at Sankalp. We had admitted meritorius students in the private schools for their bright 
                            future while also supporting them financially. We truly support the motto of 'Education for all' 
                            since the childrens of today are the citizens of tommorow. Students who will be admitted to various
                             schools of Jamshedpur are selected on merit basis by us. Regular tests are conducted at centre 
                             which form the benchmark for selecting students whom we try to get admitted in good schools.
                              We then support these kids financially by taking care of their expenses like Admission fee,
                               Tuition fee, Transport fee, and Books. Many of the alumni of NIT Jamshedpur are now sponsoring
                                some of these children of Sankalp - bearing all their financial expenses.</p>
