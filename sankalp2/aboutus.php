            <div class="well">
                <p>Sankalp is a Non-Government Organization (NGO) founded by the alumni of NIT Jamshedpur. We provide free and quality education to underprivileged children living in slums and villages near the college campus. We lay emphasis on the upliftment of people in the slums by organizing free medical checkup camp and cleanliness drive. We are a group of people with diverse interest & background sharing a common fire burning within us. It is the energy of this flame which keeps us motivated to work towards improvement & educational enrichment of young children of India.</p>
                <p>Currently sankalp is operational in the areas located at the outskirts of NIT JSR campus. The families residing here have their major sources of income from the industrial hub situated at Adityapur, Jamshedpur. Most of them are daily workers and as such cannot afford proper education for their children. Students of NIT Jamshedpur along with some hired professionals provide these children with elementary education in accordance to a standard syllabus. </p>

                <div class="well">
                <p>Sankalp emerged with the vision to inspire the privileged sections of society to work for the poor and present a model that can be replicated elsewhere. Through Sankalp we are spreading the light of knowledge to these children with an aim to explore their hidden talents and channelize it for the betterment of our nation by providing them with quality education. Initially we have targeted Mohan Nagar, a slum behind Hostel C, NIT Jamshedpur to achieve this purpose. Now we have three such centers across Adityapur with more than 90 active members and 230 kids benefitting from this initiative.</p><br>
                <p>We reach out to the most disadvantaged and neglected children and their families and help them towards development. The best way to ensure a better future for these children is by educating them. It empowers them and enables them to emerge as better citizens. We not only provide them education but also ensure that they indulge themselves into various extra co-curricular activities for their overall development.</p>

                <div class="well">
                <p>Sankalp was founded on 15th August 2007 in NIT Jamshedpur and has a governing council of its own. Students from NIT Jamshedpur volunteer during evening hours to teach the kids. It primarily targets the upliftment of children living in abject poverty and neglect. Sankalp was founded by a few young, courageous men from the 2006 and 2007 batch of NIT Jamshedpur. Prominent names among them are Mr Shivendra Srivastava, Mr Harendra Singh Gurjar and Mr Balram Rout. It was their vision which they converted into reality and today the kids are reaping benefits from the hard work they put in. The effort of the Sankalp team has paid dividends and now we are a certified NGO registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.</p><br>
